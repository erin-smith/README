## Description  

This command-line application dynamically generates an elegant,  structured README.md. The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.  Much like in life, you get out what you put in. This means that the more thoroughly the user answers the prompts in this app, the better their README.md will turn out!

An important thing to note is that having a screenshot is important to an appealing README.md. Please have a link handy for your screenshot when you answer the prompts or enter the filepath in the Repo where one is stored. This will render a classy final product.
